Currently, I am simultaneously doing two important activities, namely following the Bangkit program at MSIB online and studying on campus. This is not easy, but I have found several effective ways to adapt and do both well. Here are five ways I adapt:

1. Ways of Interacting
Interacting with others is an important part of studying and working. In the online Bangkit program, I learned to be more active in communicating through digital platforms such as Discord. While on campus, I maintain direct communication with lecturers and friends face to face. The key to success is adjusting the way I interact with the context, both online and offline.

2. Ways of Achieving
Managing achievements in two programs at once requires high discipline. I set daily and weekly targets to ensure I stay on track. In Bangkit, I focus on completing assignments and courses with a tight timeline, while on campus, I divide my time to study and complete college assignments. With good time management, I can achieve maximum results in both activities.

3. Ways of Learning
Studying in Bangkit and on campus require different strategies. In Bangkit, learning is more practical and project-oriented, so I learn a lot by "learning by doing." While on campus, academic theories remain the main focus. I learned to combine these two approaches, utilizing theoretical understanding from campus and applying it to Bangkit projects.

4. Ways of Working
The way I work also adapts to the challenges of the two educational systems. In Bangkit, I work in a cross-disciplinary team, collaborating with people from different backgrounds. This taught me the importance of openness and the ability to collaborate effectively. On the other hand, on campus, I often work individually on academic assignments, so I also learned to be independent and responsible for my own work results.

5. Ways of Thinking
Thinking flexibly is very important in undergoing these two programs. I learned to adapt quickly to changes, be it in the schedule, learning materials, or tasks given. I developed a "growth mindset," where every challenge is seen as an opportunity to learn and grow. This skill helps me stay positive and productive amidst my busy schedule.

By implementing these five methods, I can go through my studies and Bangkit program better. Adaptation is the key to achieving success amidst ever-changing demands.
